# notes-app
Basic node.js application that runs via terminal.

This is a very basic node app that I made while learning node.js

It is a note keeping app with the following functionalities:
1. Add note
2. Remove note
3. Read note
4. List all notes

## Running the app
First, clone into the repository using the git clone command
Navigate to the downloaded folder using cd
Run npm install on the terminal, and you're ready to go

Use the help flag to know more about the commands.
node app.js --help

To know more about a particular command, use command name before --help. For example,
node app.js add --help
node app.js read --help
